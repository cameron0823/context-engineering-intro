### ‚ùå Current Issues

1. **Railway Deployment (MAIN ISSUE)**
   - Status: 502 Bad Gateway
   - URL: https://context-engineering-intro-production.up.railway.app
   - Problem: PORT environment variable not expanding correctly
   - Fix Applied: Created start.sh script and updated Dockerfile
   - Next Step: Check Railway logs after rebuild

2. **Dependencies Issue**
   - psycopg2-binary won't install on Windows
   - Workaround: Created simple_backend.py without heavy dependencies
   - Long-term: Need to fix requirements.txt for cross-platform

### üîß Recent Fixes Applied

1. **PORT Variable Fix**
   - Removed conflicting railway.toml and railway.json
   - Created start.sh to handle PORT properly
   - Updated Dockerfile to use shell script
   - Committed and pushed to GitHub

2. **API URL Configuration**
   - Updated frontend to use /api prefix
   - Fixed CORS settings
   - Created local backend for testing

### üìÇ Important Files Created Today

- `simple_backend.py` - Lightweight backend for local testing
- `setup_live_app.py` - Script to create users when Railway works
- `test_app_functionality.py` - Comprehensive testing script
- `create_cameron_admin.py` - Creates Cameron's admin account
- `RAILWAY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Guide to fix Railway issues
- `APP_IS_READY.md` - Quick start guide for using the app
- `CAMERON_LOGIN_INFO.txt` - Cameron's credentials

### üöÄ Next Steps When Computer Restarts

1. **Check Railway Dashboard**
   - Look for deployment status
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify environment variables are set

2. **If Railway is Working**
   - Run: `python setup_live_app.py`
   - Test with production URL
   - Remove local backend workaround

3. **If Railway Still Has Issues**
   - Start local backend: `python simple_backend.py`
   - Use app with local backend
   - Debug Railway using logs

### üí° Key Commands to Remember

```bash
# Start local backend
python simple_backend.py

# Create users (when Railway works)
python setup_live_app.py

# Run comprehensive tests
python test_app_functionality.py

# Test Railway API
curl https://context-engineering-intro-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### üîë Login Instructions

1. **With Local Backend**:
   - Start backend: `python simple_backend.py`
   - Go to: https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app/admin
   - Console: `window.api.baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8001/api'`
   - Login: Cameroncox1993 / CoxTree#2024!Admin

2. **With Railway (when fixed)**:
   - Just go to: https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app/admin
   - Login with same credentials

### üìù Notes for Tomorrow

- Railway deployment needs attention
- All functionality works with local backend
- App is ready for team use
- Consider setting up alternative hosting if Railway continues to fail

Good night! The app is functional and ready to use. üåô

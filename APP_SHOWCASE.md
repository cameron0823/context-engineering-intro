## 💡 Key Features In Action

### 1️⃣ **Smart Calculator Engine**
The app calculates estimates using a deterministic formula:

```
Travel Costs + Labor + Equipment + Disposal + Permits
    ↓
Apply Overhead (25%)
    ↓
Add Safety Buffer (10%)
    ↓
Add Profit Margin (35%)
    ↓
Round to nearest $5
    ↓
FINAL ESTIMATE: $2,845.00
```

### 2️⃣ **Example Calculation**
For a typical tree removal job:
- **Travel**: 15 miles, 30 minutes = $22.08
- **Labor**: 6 hours × 3 crew members = $750.00
- **Equipment**: Chipper + Bucket Truck = $1,200.00
- **Disposal**: $200.00
- **Permits**: $75.00

**Final Quote: $2,845.00** (includes overhead, profit, and safety buffer)

### 3️⃣ **Estimate Management**
Your team can:
- Create professional estimates with customer details
- Track estimate status (Draft → Pending → Approved → Invoiced)
- View all estimates in one place
- Export to QuickBooks when approved

### 4️⃣ **Role-Based Access**

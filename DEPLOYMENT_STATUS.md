## üìã What You Need to Do

### 1. Fix Railway Deployment
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Check the logs for your service
3. Verify all environment variables are set:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=[from PostgreSQL service]
   REDIS_URL=[from Redis service]
   SECRET_KEY=[generate secure key]
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=context-engineering-intro-production.up.railway.app
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app
   ```
4. Try restarting the service

### 2. Once Railway is Fixed
1. Run: `python setup_live_app.py`
2. This will create all user accounts
3. Save the generated TEAM_ACCESS_INFO.txt
4. Share login details with your team

### 3. Alternative: Local Testing
If Railway continues to have issues:
1. Run backend locally: `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`
2. Update setup_live_app.py to use localhost
3. Create users locally for testing

## üìö Documentation Created

1. **RAILWAY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Complete guide to fix 502 error
2. **MANUAL_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Alternative setup without Railway
3. **TEAM_ACCESS_INFO.txt** - Will be generated after user creation
4. **team_emails.md** - Email templates for team onboarding
5. **TEAM_QUICK_START.md** - Quick reference for your team

## üéØ Success Metrics

When everything is working:
- [ ] Railway backend responds to health checks
- [ ] Users can login on mobile app
- [ ] Estimates sync between devices
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows real data
- [ ] Team has access credentials

## üí° Quick Win

Even without the backend, you can:
- Show your team the UI at https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app
- Demo the admin dashboard at https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app/admin
- Explain the workflow and features
- The UI is fully functional and looks professional!

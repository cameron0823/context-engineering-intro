# Railway Deployment - Final Checklist

## âœ… Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Add Database and Redis Plugins (if not already done)
- [ ] Go to your Railway project
- [ ] Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add PostgreSQL"
- [ ] Click "New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "Add Redis"
- [ ] Wait for both to provision

### 2. Add Missing Environment Variables
Copy and paste these exactly into Railway's environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=${{POSTGRESQL_URL}}
REDIS_URL=${{REDIS_URL}}
CORS_ORIGINS=https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app,https://cox-tree-quote-app.firebaseapp.com
PORT=${{PORT}}
ENVIRONMENT=production
ALLOWED_HOSTS=context-engineering-intro-production.up.railway.app
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FORMAT=json
DEBUG=False
```

### 3. Verify All Variables Are Set
Your Railway service should have these variables:
- [x] SECRET_KEY
- [x] GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY  
- [x] QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID
- [x] QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET
- [x] QUICKBOOKS_COMPANY_ID
- [x] FUEL_API_KEY
- [ ] DATABASE_URL
- [ ] REDIS_URL
- [ ] CORS_ORIGINS
- [ ] PORT
- [ ] ENVIRONMENT
- [ ] ALLOWED_HOSTS
- [ ] LOG_LEVEL
- [ ] LOG_FORMAT
- [ ] DEBUG

### 4. Trigger Deployment
- [ ] Click "Deploy" or push to GitHub to trigger auto-deploy
- [ ] Watch the build logs for errors
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete

### 5. Test Deployment
```bash
# Test 1: Health check
curl https://context-engineering-intro-production.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "checks": {
    "cache": {"status": "healthy"},
    "external_apis": {...}
  }
}

# Test 2: API root
curl https://context-engineering-intro-production.up.railway.app/

# Expected response:
{
  "app": "Tree Service Estimating",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### 6. Test Frontend Integration
1. Open https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app/admin
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Check for any CORS errors
4. Try to login with your credentials

### 7. If Still Getting 502 Error

Check these common issues:

1. **Database Connection**:
   - Is PostgreSQL plugin attached?
   - Check logs for database connection errors

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Check if all Python packages installed correctly
   - Look for import errors in logs

3. **PORT Configuration**:
   - Ensure PORT=${{PORT}} is set
   - Check if start.sh is executable

4. **Memory/Resource Limits**:
   - Railway free tier has limits
   - Check if app is running out of memory

### 8. View Logs
```bash
# In Railway dashboard:
1. Click on your service
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click on latest deployment
4. View "Deploy Logs" and "Runtime Logs"

# Look for:
- "Starting server on port XXXX"
- "Application startup complete"
- Any error messages
```

## Quick Fix Commands

If you need to test locally while Railway is being fixed:

```bash
# Start local backend
python simple_backend.py

# In browser console at https://cox-tree-quote-app.web.app
window.api.baseUrl = 'http://localhost:8001/api'
```

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. âœ… Health endpoint returns 200 OK
2. âœ… No CORS errors in browser console
3. âœ… Can login from Firebase frontend
4. âœ… Database operations persist data
5. âœ… No 502 errors

Good luck! ðŸš€
